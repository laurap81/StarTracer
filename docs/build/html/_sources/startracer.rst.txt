StarTracer
=====================

**StarTracer** is a Python package designed for integrating star and cluster orbits using statistical sampling methods.
Its primary purpose is to provide an uncertainty estimation of the traceback result. It is mainly based on
[galpy](https://docs.galpy.org/en/v1.9.1/) which is an [astropy](https://www.astropy.org/index.html)
[affiliated package](https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/). StarTracer is also based on astropy,
utilising the [Table](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.table.Table.html),
[SkyCoord](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/api/astropy.coordinates.SkyCoord.html),
and [Quantity](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/quantity.html) classes.
